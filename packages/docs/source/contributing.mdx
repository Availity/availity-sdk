`skd-js` is a monorepo managed using [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) in independent mode (each packages is versioned and published individually).

-   Run `npm install`
-   Commits should use the [Angular Commit Format](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#type). Scope should one of un-prefixed name of the packages under `./packages/`. If a commit applies to multiple packages, leave out the scope.
-   Release and publish using  `npm run release`. The version is determined by analyzing the commit messages.
